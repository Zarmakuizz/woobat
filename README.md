WOOBAT
======
Webapp Operator for Organizers, Better than the Atrocious TOM

I am a Tournament Organizers from the Pokémon© TCG community. For a tournament to run, you need a software doing pairings to determine who plays against who. You may do it yourself with papers and random means, but you'll quickly get a headache doing so. Better use a software for that.

TOM is the official solution to pair players, given by TPCi for Pokémon Tournament Organizers. TOM is a proprietary software that has a lot of issues, but most of them aren't being adresses at all. Recently, the software got terrible pairing issues making players upset (like facing the same opponent two times, which shouldn't happen). Thus the WOOBAT project is born.

WOOBAT is a webapp that could be run offline with the basic fonctionnalities you could expect from a desktop client. We first aim to make WOOBAT as functional as TOM - then we'll use the power of the web to bring more features.

Technologies used
======
As a webapp, mostly HTML5 things - so a lot of Javascript.
